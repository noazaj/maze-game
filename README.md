# Maze Game

A game simulation representing different pathing algorithms written in C. Algorithms ranging from BFS and DFS. Being able to visually see algorithms at work solidifies
understanding and conceptual thought. Having written it in C, it teaches the fundamentals of programming practices.

# To-Do

    * Create a 2D matrix to simulate a maze
        * Use the inputted rows and columns from the user to create the maze
    * Determine what 'char' should be used as the walls of the maze
    * A wall has four sides. So, one side of the wall needs to be open in order to create a valid, successful path.
